What you are going to make?
A  remotely controllable car. We will use Bluetooth to make the car be controllable by mobile. 

Why will you make it?
It is an interesting challenge which would provide us with a project that can cover various areas of interest as well as provide a codebase that ideally will be easy to re-use for future projects.

What problem does it solve?
It will provide a solid platform that can be re-used to interact with similar setups and allow for interactive controls of an rc car.

How you are going to make it?
The arduino will hold the logic of the movements and safety measures, the arduino will be connected by serial (usb connection) and we will use the Bluetooth connection to control the car via an app on a cellular device. We will be able to control the speed and direction of the car through controls on the mobile app.

What kind of technology you are going to use?
Arduino and SR04 Sensor.
