What you are going to make?
A web server controlled RC car. The web server will be accessible by mobile and desktop. 

Why will you make it?
It is an interesting challenge which would provide us with a project that can cover various areas of interest as well as provide a codebase that ideally will be easy to re-use for future projects.

What problem does it solve?
It will provide a solid platform that can be re-used to interact with similar setups and allow for interactive controls of an rc car.

How you are going to make it?
The arduino will hold the logic of the movements and safety measures, the arduino will be connected by serial (usb connection) and the raspberry pi will host a web server.  The web server will have commands which can be accessed by the user and on usage, the pi will use python to send commands to be parsed by the arduino as to execute.

What kind of technology you are going to use?
Raspberry pi, preliminarily LEMP stack. Arduino and SR04 Sensor.
